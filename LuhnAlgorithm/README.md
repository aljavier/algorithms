### Luhn Algorithm ###

According to Wikipedia:

    The Luhn algorithm or Luhn formula, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, is a simple 
    checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers, 
    IMEI numbers, National Provider Identifier numbers in the US, Canadian Social Insurance Numbers, and 
    Greek Social Security Numbers (ΑΜΚΑ). It was created by IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn and described in 
    U.S. Patent No. 2,950,048, filed on January 6, 1954, and granted on August 23, 1960.
